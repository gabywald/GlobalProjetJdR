\emph{The Government is on the defensive again today as its International Academic Database is hacked again.}~\\
This attack comes less than a week after a recent hack and is the third this month.

It is believed that an individual or small group is attempting to create new academic details and qualifications, perhaps offering this as a service.
Federal agents have been brought in to investigate. %% ~\\

\textbf{Amateur hacker caught and arrested}~\\
\emph{}~\\
Earlier today a man was arrested by Federal Agents for NO REASON. ~\\
The man has been named by Federal Agents as George Caleb, and is on record with a history of small time computer crime. Police who arrested him found Computer equipment and hardware for hacking in his house. It is believed this man was a part-time employee of the underground hacker group Uplink-Corporation, where he went by the hacker alias of 'Predator'.
He may not get a chance to hack again however, as he could face up to ten years in prison.

\textbf{Government social security records compromised}~\\
\emph{}~\\
The Government run social security database has been hacked by an unknown cyber criminal.~\\
Government officials insist this is the first and only incident of its kind.

In theory, unlawful changes to this database could result in dead people being reported as alive, or alive people being reported as dead. Other personal information could be stolen.
A government federal agent today stated that this would not be allowed to happen again. ~\\

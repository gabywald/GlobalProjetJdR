\textbf{Experienced computer hacker finally caught}~\\
\emph{}~\\
Earlier today a man was arrested by Federal Agents for 'NO REASON'. ~\\
The man's real name is Cody Rob and he is a well known player in the underground hacker scene. It is believed he is a full-time freelance hacker, working for several organised groups including the well known Uplink-Corporation, where he went by the hacker alias of 'Bermahn'.
Police suspect this man of multiple computer crimes and as such it is believed he will serve between ten and fifteen years inprisonment, and most likely a life ban on the use of computers.
